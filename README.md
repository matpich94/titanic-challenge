# Titanic Challenge

In this code, we compare three main classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Fully Connected Neural Network and Random Forest.

In order to compare their performance, we assess the time needed to train them on a training set, the accuracy reached on the test set and the confusion matrices.

In order to see the impact of synthetic data, we have also created fake data (inputs/swimworld.csv and inputs/titanic_tailor.csv). These data correspond to the fact that the passenger belonged or not to swimming club (0 or 1) and the weight and the height of the passenger. The goal of these synthetic data are only used to see their impact on the result of the classification.
